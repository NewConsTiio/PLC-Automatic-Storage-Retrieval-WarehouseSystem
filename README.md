As the wave of technological advancement continues, accompanied by the proliferation of various intelligent products, an increasing number of enterprises are recognizing the profound benefits of intelligent storage solutions. Currently, many warehouses grapple with the inefficiencies inherent in manual handling of goods alongside the escalating costs associated with labor. Consequently, traditional warehouse management methodologies fall short of meeting modern enterprise demands. Intelligent warehouses, however, offer a beacon of promise, furnishing businesses with more streamlined, efficient, and precise management capabilities. In response to this pressing need, a pioneering design concept emerges: an intelligent storage and transportation robot driven by PLC and servo motor technologies. This innovative solution promises to revolutionize automation levels, particularly for small-scale enterprises. Contrasted with conventional cargo handling practices, this scheme addresses the persistent challenges of time-consuming processes, diminished efficiency, and complex management systems. With its robust structure, intuitive operation, and tangible engineering applicability, this proposal signifies a significant step forward in the realm of practical warehouse automation.
